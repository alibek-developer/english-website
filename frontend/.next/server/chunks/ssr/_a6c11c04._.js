Possible fixes:
1. Ensure that the <ClerkProvider /> is correctly wrapping your application where this component is used.
2. Check for multiple versions of the \`@clerk/shared\` package in your project. Use a tool like \`npm ls @clerk/shared\` to identify multiple versions, and update your dependencies to only rely on one.
